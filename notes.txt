$ rails g model Entry
- generate a basic model template
- also generate the needed migrations and unit tests etc

$ rails d model Entry --> delete the model and the files generated in the db etc

$ rails g scaffold Entry
--> creates CRUD stuff 

$ rails g scaffold Entry meal_type:string calories:integer proteins:integer carbohydrates:integer fats:integer

- we created a new model so the schema was updated, need to migrate it. Can either do it on localhost:3000 (press the button or execute a migrate command)
$ rails db:migrate

- go to routes.rb file, the resources:entries line has automatically created default routes
find them here: 
http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes


- gemfile --> install dependencies (this is the mvn or package.json)


- in /app/views/entries/index.html.erb
the <%=notice %> is like a vairable, tells ruby to inject a notice 
corresponding controller --> entries_controller.rb, def create, format.html{notice...}

partials
- new.html.erb
    - partial injected through <% render 'form', entry: @entry %>
    - inject it into the _Form.html.erb file => render this file
